        Imagine that we have Tailwind installed in our project.
        - ->
        <h1 class="bg-gray-300 text-red-400">is this different from the h1 in level 3, if so, how is it different?</h1>
        <!-- it's different because in this case the class is used to write tailwind, then you don't
         have to have a special css file to change the color, you write it all in the html file -->
    </body>
