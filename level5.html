    Now comes the first thing we have never seen before, namely TypeScript.
    Try to read it and guess what it does, write in a comment what you think it will do
    Next use Google, ChatGPT and/or Claude to find out what it does.
    write in another comment what it actually does and see if it is far from what you thought it did
    - ->
    <script>
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    </script>
    <!-- in h1 you put the Id="greeting"
     in the script you call the greeting and make it to be "Hello, world!" now if you use "greeting" you get hello world -->
</body>
</html>
