//you can comment this file too by adding // before the comment
let greeting = "Hello, world!";
document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = greeting;

//from now on all the HTML files will look the same so there is no need to comment them


// The id="greeting" in the <h1> tag makes it easy for JavaScript to find that specific element.
// The JavaScript creates a greeting variable with the text "Hello, world!" in it.
// Then, document.getElementById("greeting") takes the <h1> element, and innerHTML updates it with the
// value of greeting, so the page shows "Hello, world!" in the heading.
